## 🧾 1. Adding My Card to AWS

Before doing anything, I had to **verify my AWS account by linking a card**. Here’s how I did it:

### ✅ Step-by-step:
1. I visited [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and logged into my AWS account
2. Clicked on my **account name** → **Billing Dashboard**

3. On the sidebar, I went to **Payment Methods**  
4. I clicked **Add a Card** and entered my ATM card details

## 📦 2. Creating the S3 Bucket

Next, I went to **S3 from the AWS Console** to start setting up the website.

### 🪣 Steps I followed:
1. Searched **S3** in the AWS search bar and opened the service  
2. Clicked **Create Bucket**

3. I gave my bucket a unique name: `my-s3-website-demo`  
4. **Unblocked public access** by unchecking the setting  
5. Acknowledged the warning and hit **Create Bucket**

## ⚙️ 3. Adjusting Bucket Permissions & Properties

For the site to be public, I had to make two key changes in the bucket:

### 🔐 Permissions:
In the **Permissions** tab, I added this bucket policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-website-demo/*"
    }
  ]
}
````

> Replace `my-s3-website-demo` with your bucket name.

### 🌐 Properties:

Then in **Properties**, I scrolled to **Static Website Hosting** and:

* Enabled it
* Set:

  * `index.html` as the index document
  * `error.html` as the error document (optional)
* Saved the changes

## 💻 4. Building My Website in VS Code

### 🗂️ Folder Setup

I opened **VS Code** and created a folder named `my-s3-site`.

![VS Code Folder](images/vscode-create-folder.png)

### ✏️ index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My First S3 Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello from AWS S3!</h1>
  <p>This site is hosted using Amazon S3.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### ✏️ error.html (Optional)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Error - Page Not Found</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>404 - Oops!</h1>
  <p>Looks like the page you’re looking for doesn’t exist.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 💾 I saved both files in the same folder.

## 📤 5. Uploading My Website Files

### 🖱️ Option A: Manual Upload

1. I went to the bucket → **Objects**
2. Clicked **Upload**
3. Selected my `index.html` and `error.html` files
4. Clicked **Upload**

![Upload Files](images/aws-upload-files.png)

### 🔄 Option B: (Optional) AWS CLI

Once I set up the AWS CLI locally, I used:

```bash
aws s3 sync ./my-s3-site s3://my-s3-website-demo --acl public-read
```

---

## 🔓 6. Making Files Public

After uploading, I had to make the files public manually:

* Selected `index.html` → Actions → **Make public**
* Did the same for `error.html`

## 🌍 7. Viewing My Website

Finally, I went back to the **Properties** tab → **Static website hosting**, copied the **website endpoint**, and opened it in my browser:

![Website Live](images/website-live.png)

It worked! 🎉

## ✏️ 8. Updating My Site Later

Whenever I edit my site in VS Code, I can update it:

### Manual:

* Re-upload the new files via the console

### CLI:

```bash
aws s3 sync ./my-s3-site s3://my-s3-website-demo --acl public-read
```
